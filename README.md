# Inspirit-AI-Program

these two projects I completed during the Inspirit AI program. The first project is a skin cancer diagnosis model using a convolutional neural network, grid search convoulutional neural network, and a transfer learning model. The data was given and downloaded beforehand. the second project is a web app used to see if a certain image has malaria or not. Data was given and downloaded beforehand. There are also a set of 10 images you are able to test with the web app.
